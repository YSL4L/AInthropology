 Alright, so first of all, thank you very much that you agreed on doing this interview with me. And I would directly come to my first question I would like to ask you. And my first question would be, what were your first steps to prepare your arrival in Rome? My first steps to prepare a arrival? Well, it was interesting story because everything happened like in the last week. Yeah. I had like two days before my flight. I was still working. I had like one free day with in between. And I didn't have like any payment. And I also like I knew that I was supposed to receive full month and like other half of payment at the last day. And because I had to move out of the dorm, I also didn't have like a time to normally do that. A long time ago, I moved out of my dorm like three days before flight and also met my friends like also two days and the last week. And also work. And then on the last day, like just one day before my flight at about a package. Yeah. So, and also like what else about our closing? I mean, and during the night before flight, I packed my stuff everything. And I didn't have like that's a waiting thing to measure the weight. I didn't do much stuff. But I had closing. I had, you know, basic things for cleaning like tea or everything. And my at the end, we were so afraid to like also bring the ball zone battle. Like I'm not dead. Bring the ball zone battle and with a mannequin because I'm the number was supposed to receive it. But anyway, yeah. And then my baggage was just 11 kilograms. That's a lot. He had a lot. But he's one, he had his baggage like 19, 25. Yeah. But yeah. And also in regarding of your arrival, we talked a bit more earlier about like those groups. Like for example, the Erasmus and Rome Association group. How did you how did you find out about those groups or about this group in particular? And what was your intention behind joining this group? Like what did you thought about joining this group? What was your intention? First intention was, you know, you... The first thing that came to my mind, I have to, you know, get a place to live. Yeah. Right. And it's a fine apartment. I was looking at the photo apartment myself as well. And also almonds with both did some kind of research. But he actually did most of the work. Because I put him responsible to communicate with the landlord. And well at first like in April, May of the last year, I told him, okay, you've found a good place. And also he communicated to Erasmus. So Erasmus students. Students and I also remember that you were the one of it. Yeah. I think through that platform, right? Yeah, we met already, I think. Yeah, and we created the Watson group together. Three of us searching the apartment. Yeah. And yeah, you were a little bit lost at some point. But and we tried to communicate with you if you really want something good with us together as well. But at the end, we noticed that a lot of places are getting like booked in the May. And at the last May, we felt pressure to like book this apartment, which was kind of like new, the old, via Appian, ticket place. And we did it to unit places, platform for student renting. And yeah, for like month, I felt like it was a little bit my fault as well that I didn't control arguments. And he didn't come actually message to landlord like for months, for like month and three, more than a month. Yeah. And maybe that was the fault that we lost the apartment at the end because the July asked the armman, can you please like ask if we have pillows and sheets and everything. So I do have to buy or something. And three weeks passed, a landlord was not very communicative. And then, and the first August, I remember there was a message. The vendor told me, okay, I will get, I will inform you as soon as possible, I get the information from my mother or something. And then two weeks before flight, our apartment and each of our separate rooms in via Appian, the cash, the place where canceled. And then, yeah. And then we searched for a new apartment. But of course, I had a backup plan, I had a contact through WhatsApp from an old generation in apartment. And I found, I texted her through Facebook. And she asked her, she still has a free room for two or more people. She said, yes, she had an arm was was wearing, you know, no, we will have separate rooms. I will not leave you in the room, never. And one day later, okay, I will give you 24 hours. If you find a better option, you didn't 24 hours. Okay, we will take that. But trustable. Okay. And next, next afternoon, I asked her, so arm was, were there your options? Man. And he's like, the slow Italian is always never responding to me. And he searched through apartment through the Alistair platform. But they usually ran through the one year. And it was on luck. So thank God, I don't know, I accepted this. And we have this good apartment. I mean, we have four, six months. And the other option, yeah, if we go back to WhatsApp platform when we started to get in a Rasmus and start to communicate. And Rasmus drove the first thing. I remember that arm was communicated through Rasmus soon. And he found two girls who are also looking for him. Okay. So I was asking at the first, the landlord, which is my current one, if they have a room for five people or something. And they were also like in the number research group. And that's how actually we found the first WhatsApp source of information. It was through them too. Because I think those two girls sent WhatsApp information to armats and armats through me. That's how first I got into kind of like my Rasmus network meeting circle in the entry WhatsApp. And I mean, it's also like maybe on the Facebook, because you know, armats maybe communicating through Facebook. To Facebook as well. Facebook, Facebook, Facebook. I don't know. Because I used, I used, I once used email as well to communicate to you maybe. And to be also used like Google, Excel, online thing. To make the list for your apartments, right? And so you already like told a bit like how you initially got into the group. Yes. Like the WhatsApp groups. And how did it went from there? Like, for example, what was your first interaction with the city, like your first meeting with the people and how did that come together? Well, you know, first you arrived, you don't know nothing. Yes. It was not anything. It was more bad for us because we didn't do any research. I had my gift of you know the tourist book, the book at Robert. Yeah. At the two days before that. Okay, I never read it. But we had this Rasmus group. It was like right later I realized that it's just maximum number of people that can be in a group is like 250 or so. Yeah, it was one of the seven or so things. Yeah. It was a pretty random situation. And the second September, it was morning and the after-after-after-know-how as well. And we went to Little, I think, first. And I was like, oh my god, this city is so amazing. And yeah, and then after living, me and Arman's we were just thinking about where to go. Maybe he already had like a year with other people as well because he had a contact with Alba, I think. And maybe other people as well, but he intentioned to meet at Guteria MNL. And we both went to Guteria and we thought I'm an other park. And at this point, at this point, we were messaging in what's appropriate, I think we are at Metodemella, come here to meet, like with Martin. And yeah, and I remember the first people I met, it was of course like Dunia, Grace from Greece, some kind of Ferdinand from Portugal and others, other men, other guys. Other people in general, yeah. That's pretty interesting actually. And so this was like your first encounter, we all met, we told you in Manoeuille Park. You had it, I met Dunia first. I met Dunia. I met Chris, I remember him. I met Fernanda, but I never like texted, I never like really didn't ask contacts to everyone, I don't know, my fault. But yeah, a lot of interesting people, like just the group, Hannah and maybe Sunia as well that we met at that place. And yeah, we went to, and further like why the September was so active before that, I want to mention yeah, you met at the Scala Playground. But before that, I wanted to mention that, oh my god. No, thank you. Thank you, you're welcome. Yeah, we were meeting and to what's up, grow for Victoria and Manoeu. Park, yes. Yes. And then you went to Scalo? Don't worry, maybe it will come to your mind later. What would be interesting for me, so you describe it as me. Yeah, what would, so this was like one particular like urban space you went to like the Victoria and Manoeuille Park, right? So this was like the first event. What other kind of events or places or activities in general have you been to doing it like due to this participating in what's up groups or online in general? Yes, thank you for the question. That was also the one of the things I wanted to mention you. It's the first, you know, a rest of the people come, they don't understand anything much. And the WhatsApp group, the main source of the information and maybe also like Facebook group of the ESN, Asse or Erasmus. Yeah, just was other people, source of information and they just kept suggesting what to do to others as well through the main main WhatsApp. And other events, for example, there was some kind of a worry or something. He organized a trip first to Santa Sadas, Tjernb√ºj, something like a black sandwich. And we were there, Jorge, Carmen, other people, Dunean as well and others. And we went there, it was like an initiative connected to Erasmus group. And then there was like this guy, Antonio or something that said, let's go to the Aqueduct Park. But at the end I was the only one who went to the park. And we just got lost, walked along with him all the time. But what else? Yeah, then we went to Austria, which was mainly an initiative. Austria Beach. Austria Beach. Many times, many Saturdays and Sundays. And Skull Playground kind of went very popular. I mean, I think it's between the people, you know, nobody knows a lot of places where to go. Let's go to Skull Playground. So everyone goes there, exactly everyone. And there were like the events from the ERRs, well like the club events. Yes, the first club, I remember it, it was like a just still-comp situation. But everyone was like, let's go to the club and outside. And ESN was kind of like partly making partly illegal substitutes. Clubs is. For events. And I went to three ESN and there were like one party at New York, New York, New York Architecture, via Gramps T Street. And yeah, at one hour of the event and one after one hour, the music was shut down. Someone called the police. And then the second event asked as well. People kept calling the police, I guess. But yeah, and then when also other clubs were allowed, we went to Alibi, which was also a source of information to WhatsApp or other people. Also, it was not only like just the virtual communication. It was also like between ourselves, you know, talking. Yeah. Until then, trips, I didn't want to trips at the first two months. But I heard about them. I just kind of like there were a lot of information coming from that those groups. And I didn't thought about going to those trips at that time. But later on, like in December, through our months, I think, yeah, we went with our trip in December. It was the first like organized trip we went. Other apps, other events were like also. It's not just the, you know, sand beach or like everything they just do, everything they could imagine. And also we had like some kind of operatives at Sundays. And basically it was just a weekly planned. Then they can like little bit start to repeat. But mostly it was Wednesdays. It was also like karaoke events. Yeah. Listening to the music. So now we're actually like many, many different places in the city, like many, many, many urban sectors. You actually went to throughout this event. And for me, what would be very interesting to hear? How is your access to like digital research, to like internet, mobile devices and stuff? How would you describe that fear? So my access, before I went to Italy, you know, you have your own internet connection. Yeah. True, which is my nationality in my country where I have lived for my entire life. And you know, there are some labs, you know, it's unlimited internet, you know, between your country. And then suddenly you look to another country and you realize that you may run into a pretty huge bill after you use your internet. If you don't get a second SIM card. So we looked at proposals by Italian SMS companies that they can give us like almost unlimited or pretty good deal. And we found like a fast web, which source of information I think it was Instagram because you know, era, growth. And the government was looking for like, era car sales. And you know, the Philippa works one of the guys, you know, who is responsible of the company. He works also in a fast web, I recently discovered. And they had a pretty good deal for like five euros to have 90 gigabytes of internet per month. No. And then I did that like his first card calls, only calls from my own source of country, which I used to communicate mainly, you know, with everyone like because there's no limits to between European, Union and European economic zone. And the other card was just internet. So yeah, it was like I paid, I still pay I think like 12, 12 euros, now eight euros, now eight euros for lesbian board and more like five euros for internet here in Italy. Okay. But in general, you felt like that you always was able to, you know, write on WhatsApp and to communicate with people. So that was possible still. Yes, it was very good. Based on that my decision that we had this opportunity and also like to SIM cards to use in the same phone, like not everyone have. Yeah. If you wouldn't have, then it would be actually a problem. Yeah. That kind of leads me to my next question is because now what like you told me a lot of things you did throughout like, which were created in the WhatsApp groups like through this kind of digital participation. Now my question would be like if you wouldn't have been able to, you know, participate in those WhatsApp group whether it was because you had a bad internet or maybe you would have never found those groups. How would you have acted like how would you have tried to still participate within the city and to attend events if you wouldn't have found out about those groups, for example, like, did you feel that there were like other ways to find out about the events and the stuff? If I completely exclude out my WhatsApp option, right? And yeah, and the other, maybe even though, yeah, even the social media options as well, do you think there will be, was it still able to see the events and to get in touch with certain things? You know, if I mean like, like would be very analogic and very, you know, like, no, like no phone, yeah. And then I'm not even sure if, like, the organization by ESN puts like, uh, old, you know, like, flyers and like apartments, like you get in the mailbox, a lot of like, spam fires of the solo pizza. Yeah, but, uh, I mean, probably for, for your accessing urban sectors, I mean, you still would have the option to go to parks or probably to other places, but, um, like, especially for the events, I think it could be a bit harder, right? To include error, I could be able to go in other places. I couldn't use my phone. If I, I mean, first, if I wouldn't use my phone, yeah, I mean, I printed out my QR code that I could get access first. And then the internet connection, which is like the main thing of the topic. Yeah. Um, I don't have internet. Well, uh, human source of information, but if they others don't have internet, then everyone, all the communication changed to the one that we have, the, my, uh, inch, inches, there's, yeah, inches three hats. Yeah, so, 20? Yeah, here's it. Yeah, I understand that. But, uh, what would I, uh, what would I do? For example, like, if it's like pretty realistic ordinary situation, if you don't have like, from dead, gone, stolen or whatever, yeah, I mean, I think I would, um, follow more people that I'm around. Yeah. So more analog communication. Yes. More going out. Um, in general, when we talk about communicating with people, do you feel that it was easier for you to communicate with people online because it's more anonymous than maybe if you actually meet persons and approach persons, do you feel that was easier for you to communicate throughout those groups and to participate within those groups? Thank you. Uh, I felt kind of easy because I have been, um, I have participated in, like, uh, in previous years, I have had experience in, uh, participating, uh, in, um, free work, I think how to call it, free work. Yeah, yeah, yeah, free lens, free lens thing, yeah. Uh, and, uh, I have been in, uh, once we were sort of, uh, whatever and I also have had to show initiative, uh, I have added a digital work for, like, uh, poster designs in 2015. And we've made our own organization of, like, youth people. And, uh, you can repeat a question if you want. Yeah, of course. So my question was basically, like, uh, if it was easier for you to communicate with, uh, people online than, um, offline, you know, like, if it's easier for you to, to, for example, ask people in the group to go out, then if you would go out on the street and ask people in person, oh, do you want to go out today? Like a random people, uh, random person. So if it was more easier for you online, uh, to do that than, than offline with, especially strange, uh, strangers. Yeah, I think, uh, online, because actually, like, you met the person first, I mean, probably if, I mean, what's the first source? You can't really like, uh, be without it. Yeah. I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, I mean, uh, you can't really like, uh, be without it. Yeah. Because it's, um, because it's so, uh, so necessary thing, like almost like a normal thing to have, like, I was having like, uh, I don't know, pants when you're self-form. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good thing. Yeah. But do you see any problems that could be related to this, like, participating online, like, the, for example, now in our context, the Rasmus, like, do you see any problems in this digital participation, for example, within those WhatsApp groups? Like, is there any problem related to it for you? For me. Or in general, like, if you think about it, like, for example, like, that, it feels a little bit foggy, you know? Yeah. It's like, uh, you have so many groups and then you can get fast and information and it's kind of like, you have so many groups and then you just, your brain just shuts down and they don't want to like, uh, uh, look at everything that you know and, uh, and little eats to the problem that you get the news later because of this, kind of like so many chats and exposures and you have to put them on the silence. And then because of this reason of so many news and so many opinions on these groups, uh, coming, uh, then, um, it leads to this, you know, delay or information actually. It's kind of like fast information. Yeah. At the same time, it's kind of like delayed. Do you think that, um, people, for example, might get excluded from, um, you know, they're interacting with the city if we think about what we talked on earlier, like, um, if you don't, would have the option to access internet or say it, or things, or if you wouldn't have found this group, do you think that this, the existence of these groups could also lead to exclusion, um, of other people who are not finding out about those groups or don't, are not able to access those groups properly. First, the groups are, you know, separated. Yeah. Pretty because of the limit of the people that can be in this one group. One group is that and the other friend is in the other group. Yeah. They still share the same information, but, um, it's, uh, divided, you know, between the communication of the people and questions. And one person knows one question, one answer of the one thing and other never. And, um, but for that, we have, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the other app. Um, the telecom. Telecom. Yeah. I haven't used it yet at all. Maybe I should. And, uh, it was, well, problems, it was the question. Yeah, like, like, what is, like, if, if, if there is, like, problems connected to the digital participation, like, um, you couldn't imagine, like you can think of, for example, again, like, okay, okay. Yeah. For example, uh, in a park, there are usually, like, uh, exhibition, um, you know, what is the modern exhibitions, they use QR codes to, like, additional information. I believe that. That's an idea. Um, like, QR codes are so everywhere. Like, you just have to scan it to get to know that or, like, recipe, like, even nowadays they're introducing to, like, also new technology of shopping with just the phone, remote shopping, but I haven't never done it. Yeah. So getting, like, so, uh, dependent on the phone use. And also, problem is like too much phone usage. Just heart your eyes. Like, that's true as well. Um, yeah. No, um, um, yeah. For example, I see a transportation is also, I can imagine that as my opinion, transportation. You don't know the city, you don't walk with analog map. Yeah. When, uh, I have had this experience of, like, shutting down my phone suddenly because, you know, battery ends up, because you have to use a lot of, uh, navigation, which hurts your battery. And, uh, when my phone have, uh, shut down, either I try, once I got lost in the city, but I somehow found a similar street which led to my intuition and I got home. But, um, uh, other option is to use, you know, you get to find a bus stops and they have a map of the city. Yeah. Use it instead. So the problem is getting lost. Yeah. I'm pretty much because you don't know your location where you are at that moment. And it's hard to find your way exactly. Yes. Uh, okay. For example, I'll show a documentation. If you have, if you go in a hotel or any type of, like, recreation, you must provide, maybe some documents of your health or anything. And you usually don't print them out. And you use your phone to show them up. And if you, if you don't have it, then it's a huge problem. You can enter it. Yeah. And also, uh, okay. For example, moving around, you see, like, so many transportation, which is like kind of easier than the public transport is so dependent on the phone. For example, you have dot app to try to use to trends. I mean, not rarely, but it's still option. If you go with friends to move to near areas and you have to scan your code to actually activate that thing. Yeah. So the people who don't have phone, it's a problem. Or even by bus tickets and stuff. That's a problem. Yeah, sure, sure, sure. It's a bus. I'll show it to you. Which is like pretty. Yeah. And used and you, when you buy tickets, either you have, if you are at home, or how will you get a ticket at the last evening before the bus, before the train. Yeah. You buy it on computer or phone. And of course, then use phone to actually show it if you don't have a printer. And other ways, just to go to somehow, if you know, to the biggest train station and then, you know, buying the ticket from the ticket machine. And also, money can be accessed with that phone. That's pretty okay. Yeah. That's not a problem. I would have one last question for you. And that would be, what would be your resume of the participation within the mentioned platforms, like for example, within the Erasmus group? And of course, with other things as well, what's your overall resume of doing that? How would you rate it? If I were to tease the thesis, if you know what that means, because that's his. Yeah. You can take it at home to answer it. Don't worry. Phone is nowadays very normal, like almost like, must have thing to use, which have led to dependents on many ways of moving around the transportation, communication, accessing when you are showing your documents. Also interacting with like a food or something, if you want to look at some kind of ingredient, they don't have the information themselves, maybe. You have to also use the phone to access this information, because, you know, you have to get this dependence on instant need of information instant. Yeah, especially since you're an international student, like for all of us international students, when you come to a strange city, there is a lot of things you don't know and you need to find out about, right? So this kind of digital participation has like a certain need for international students to find out about some things, which you can't find out regularly without like a digital device, right? Or would you say you can also come as an international student to Rome and find out about everything without having your phone? Do you think that's possible as well? It would be a pretty good challenge actually, but I mean, everything is sometimes as possible, but it's really philosophical thing now. It's, I mean, everyone is just putting, you know, references, use Instagram, Facebook, you know, other software. Universities, well, right? When we get to university, which is self, you know, the main source where you come to the Rasmus, they had like a welcome day, but it was also like, you know, we get to know it through emails to the future. We could go there, but it was very overall, you know, referencing you and go to ESN, organization and of course, then to like other social media platforms, you get to the main information. So it's like a very dependent on the most popular social networking platforms. What's your goal? Well if there is nothing more that comes to your mind, I can give you also a minute if there is anything else you would like to say. But in another case, if you don't have anything, you ask me if it would be so viable. And if you think of the perspective of international students, especially which role digital participation plays in general, to access the city, to interact with the city, how important that is. Every time I did you a thing turns off, I get lost. So I can't also do language is also a problem. You can't really like ask everyone. If you translate and show the phone like text, then it's passed. Yeah. And then you could just go on. That's right. Actually for me it's the same because in most of the cases, okay, so I know the basic Italian things to order maybe, but if you want to speak still and you want to find out, oh, what does the science say? And you Google it. And without Googling it, you just stand there. And I mean, the other option would be to maybe ask someone in English or can you translate that to me. But it's harder. It's way much more harder, right? Well, if my phone is off, then I realize I use more person communication with people. Because I got lost in the forums because my phone died and I went with the, okay, I left my phone to charge. Yeah. And I went with the group and I knew it with the group. I couldn't go back to hostile and everything would be fine for that hour or two. And actually I went to that mountain and then back and realized that on the WhatsApp, I was supposed to receive an information that bus is already awaiting. And I was still sitting and I didn't sell that message. So I missed the bus and I just searched that there were still like two or three girls who were still there. And thank God they let me to host up. So otherwise you would have been lost. Yeah. No, I would just in a cold cold. Yeah, like sitting there and you're like, not sitting, but I would just go on my way on my instincts to, I would ask people, do you know where is the hot cell that that that that. Yeah. And I think I would found my backpack but it would be very long. Very, very scarce, stressful. Yeah, so in general, like most of the things you experienced here during your stay or still experiencing, you kind of like did them throughout the communication on that, right? Like the WhatsApp groups and further things. Okay. Then Richard, thank you very much for the opportunity to interview you. It was a pleasure. And within this I end the memo. Thank you.
